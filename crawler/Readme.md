# **Web Crawler with Spring Boot**

This repository contains a basic implementation of a **web crawler** built using **Spring Boot**. The crawler systematically fetches and processes web pages, extracts links, and stores content in a database. Designed for scalability and extensibility, this project serves as a foundation for building custom search engines or data collection tools.

## **Features**
- **Seed URL Crawling**: Start crawling with a predefined seed URL.
- **URL Management**: Queue system for tracking visited and pending URLs.
- **HTML Parsing**: Extract content and links from web pages using `Jsoup`.
- **Data Storage**: Save crawled content in a database (PostgreSQL).
- **REST API**: Easily trigger crawling processes via HTTP endpoints.
- **Extensible Design**: Built for scalability, allowing additional features like multi-threading, distributed crawling, or machine learning-based ranking.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **HTML Parsing**: Jsoup
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or any other relational database)
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Language**: Java

## **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-crawler-springboot.git
   ```
2. Add your PostgreSQL credentials in `application.properties`.
3. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. Start crawling by making a POST request to `/crawler/start` with a seed URL.

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Respect robots.txt** for ethical crawling.
- Implement **multi-threaded crawling** for faster performance.
- Add support for **distributed crawling** using Kafka or RabbitMQ.
- Integrate **machine learning models** for intelligent content prioritization.
