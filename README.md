### **Ustaad: A Microservices-Based Search Engine**

**Ustaad** is a scalable and modular search engine built using a microservices architecture to deliver efficient, high-performance, and customizable search solutions. Designed with a focus on flexibility and extensibility, Ustaad's architecture decomposes the search engine into independent, purpose-driven microservices, each handling a specific core function of a modern search engine.

## **Core Services**

### **1. Crawler Service**
- Systematically browses the web, fetches web pages, and extracts structured data.
- Adheres to web standards like `robots.txt` and implements politeness policies.
- Can scale horizontally to handle millions of URLs.

### **2. Indexer Service**
- Processes crawled data to create and maintain a structured index for rapid search retrieval.
- Supports advanced indexing strategies like tokenization, stemming, and synonym handling.
- Utilizes distributed databases or search engines like Elasticsearch for scalable storage.

### **3. Processor Service (Query Processor)**
- Handles user queries, parses search inputs, and translates them into optimized search requests.
- Supports features like spell correction, query suggestion, and natural language processing (NLP).
- Ranks and retrieves the most relevant results based on algorithms like TF-IDF or BM25.

## **Supporting Services**

### **1. API Gateway**
- Centralized entry point for all client interactions, ensuring seamless communication with internal services.
- Provides load balancing, request routing, and security features like authentication and rate limiting.

### **2. Service Registry**
- Maintains a dynamic registry of all microservices, enabling smooth service discovery and load balancing.
- Ensures fault-tolerant communication between services.

### **3. Data Processing Service**
- Analyzes large datasets for insights, trends, and search relevance optimization.
- Handles preprocessing tasks like deduplication, format conversion, and metadata extraction.

### **4. Monitoring and Logging**
- Real-time monitoring and logging for tracking system health, performance, and errors.
- Uses tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack.

## **Features of Ustaad**
1. **Modular Design**: Each component operates independently, allowing for easy updates, maintenance, and scaling.
2. **High Scalability**: Designed to scale horizontally to handle millions of requests and datasets efficiently.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Microservices ensure that failures in one component do not impact others.
4. **Customizable**: Easily extendable to support custom ranking algorithms, data types, or user preferences.
5. **Real-Time Search**: Combines batch processing and streaming data for near real-time updates to search results.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Elasticsearch (for search indices)
- **Message Queuing**: Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ
- **API Management**: Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Service Registry**: Eureka or Consul
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes

## **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrNerdyPants/Ustaad.git
   ```
2. Set up environment variables and configuration files for the microservices.
3. Deploy each service using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
4. Use the API Gateway for client interactions and trigger crawling, searching, and query processing.

## **Future Enhancements**
- **NLP-Based Search**: Add support for semantic search and conversational queries.
- **User Personalization**: Incorporate user behavior and preferences into ranking algorithms.
- **Distributed Crawling**: Use distributed systems for faster and broader web crawling.
- **AI-Powered Features**: Integrate AI models for better relevance, recommendations, and predictive analytics.

**Ustaad** is not just a search engine but a powerful, extensible platform designed for innovation in search technologies.
